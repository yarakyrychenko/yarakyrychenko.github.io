I'm a PhD Candidate and [Gates Scholar](https://www.gatescambridge.org) at the [Cambridge Social Decision-Making Lab](https://www.sdmlab.psychol.cam.ac.uk/staff/yara-kyrychenko), advised by [Sander van der Linden](https://www.sdmlab.psychol.cam.ac.uk/staff/prof-sander-van-der-linden) and [Jon Roozenbeek](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/jon-roozenbeek). I combine psychological theory with data and behavioral science methods to study how we can make human-technology interactions more constructive.

I am part of the Alan Turing Institute’s Enrichment Scheme, focusing on the social evaluation of large language models. I completed a research internship with Nokia Bell Labs’ Responsible AI team, working on Constitutional AI.

I also organize the [Cambridge Social Psychology Seminar Series](https://talks.cam.ac.uk/show/index/9110) and co-manage the CSDM Lab. 

#### more about me

In May 2022, I graduated summa cum laude from [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu) with a double major in Mathematics (Honors) and Psychology. I was an associate research scientist at [Tessa West](https://tessawestlab.hosting.nyu.edu) and [Jay Van Bavel](https://www.jayvanbavel.com/lab)'s labs, where I mainly used data science techniques to study group processes. I'm passionate about advancing and supporting women in science and technology. I write about data science, education, and life on [Medium](https://medium.com/@k.yara). I grew up in Kyiv, Ukraine, and my native languages are Ukrainian and Russian.
